# Mini Audit Report – OpenZeppelin ERC-20 Token

**Auditor:** B.Ali 
**Date:** June 13, 2025  
**Contract:** ERC20.sol (OpenZeppelin)

---

## 1. Overview

This contract implements the ERC-20 token standard, providing essential functions for token transfers, allowances, and balance tracking. The implementation uses OpenZeppelin’s widely adopted and audited library.

## 2. Findings

| Severity | ID | Title                         | Status   |
|----------|----|-------------------------------|----------|
| Low      | #1 | Potential double-spend in approve pattern | Noted   |

---

### Issue #1 – Double-spend risk in `approve()` pattern  
**Severity:** Low  
**Description:**  
ERC-20 `approve()` can lead to race conditions if the spender uses the allowance before it is changed. This is a known pattern in ERC-20 and typically mitigated by first setting allowance to zero before changing it.

**Recommendation:**  
Educate users and developers to follow the safe approve pattern, or consider using `increaseAllowance` and `decreaseAllowance` functions where possible.

---

## 3. Summary

The contract is solid and follows best practices by relying on OpenZeppelin’s audited code. The main risk lies in user behavior with allowances, which is a known limitation of the ERC-20 standard rather than the contract itself.
